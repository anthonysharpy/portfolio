            <p>This website is built in React, <a href="https://github.com/anthonysharpy/portfolio" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here's the source code for it</a> üòÅ</p>
            <p>I actually have more experience using Angular, but since React is a lot more common, React it was! However, I worked for a year with Angular (version 7 I think it was). Here are some examples of the sorts of things I worked on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://quotes.insuremystuff4less.com/static/caravan" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://quotes.insuremystuff4less.com/static/caravan</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://quotes.insuremystuff4less.com/taxi/vehicle" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://quotes.insuremystuff4less.com/taxi/vehicle</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Obviously not all of that was made by me, and it's changed slightly since I worked there, but not much.</p>
            <p>I also used Vue.js/Laravel in a commercial setting for one and a half years, working on an internal corporate system.</p>
            <h2>Site layout</h2>
            <p>I opted for a single-page website since not only is this much simpler, but it also makes the site feel more responsive (And unique!). This probably isn't a good idea for more complicated sites, since downloading and rendering the whole thing at once could make the initial page load too long. Also, having everything on one page likely harms search-engine optimisation, and makes it trickier to share a page with someone else by copy-pasting the URL. But it works nicely on simple sites like mine.</p>
            <p>I wanted a simple and modern layout that was easy to navigate and that conveyed an upbeat and positive message, whilst also being unique and a bit show-offy. The site is optimised for desktop but has also been designed to display correctly on mobile and tablet. I chose not to minify the CSS etc since I want people to be able to see the good (and bad) design decisions I have made.</p>
            <h2>Tech decisions</h2>
            <p>The background animations are created from scratch using React Three Fiber, which is a React wrapper around the three.js graphics library. In hindsight it would have been better just to use three.js natively; Fiber adds some overhead in that it requires that the scene is re-generated every time you add or remove an object. There are probably ways around this, but this is not really something I felt like it was worth spending days and days on.</p>
            <p>I wrote the site using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. The reason for this was simply to prove I could do it! Other than that, it actually made it much more difficult because I had to constantly write-out the types of everything I was using (and with the graphics library on top, that quickly got cumbersome). That being said, no doubt the rigidity that TypeScript provides is great for large or complex projects, even if it does slow you down a bit. Personally I thought that the clarity the types provided was helpful when I was working on the physics logic (see below).</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>The background</h2>
            <p>The scene in the background is dynamically generated and rendered. The scene is essentially a number of cubes spawning randomly (I like to pretend they're meteors) that explode into pieces when collided with.</p>
            <p>The scene relies on a rudimentary gameplay loop that processes physics and object-specific logic. Scene state is stored in the <code>SceneState</code> class. All scene objects derive from a <code>SceneObject</code> base class in order to keep things uniform. For example, each object has a <code>mesh</code>, <code>velocity</code>, <code>angularVelocity</code>, <code>rotation</code> and <code>position</code>, among other characteristics. Physics behaviour is abstracted into its own <code>CollisionHandler</code> base class which is further extended for each shape type.</p>
            <p>I created the collision logic myself. It's nothing too fancy - just a bunch of spheres and a floor. But it is kinda cool in that we get to simulate things like gravity and drag. I would have made the scene more intense, but in the end no amount of micro-optimisation could fix the slow, interpreted, single-core disappointment that is JavaScript.</p>
