        <p>C++ was probably the first language I got into properly. Well, I say C++, but actually at the time my monstrous spaghetti code was more like glorified C, since I didn't really <em>get</em> what OOP was all about at the time.</p>
        <p>That being said C++ is not something I have used commercially or something I try and keep up-to-date with. But I am familiar with it and I know that some companies do use it for part of their tech stack, so I'm putting some stuff here.</p>
        <h2>GNU Compiler Collection contributions</h2>
        <p>A few years ago I contributed some bug fixes for the GNU C++ compiler. I won't blabber on about what they were but you can see some examples below of the kind of work I did.</p>
        <p><a  href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/7e0f147a29f42d6149585573650bd4827f3b2b93" target="_blank">https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/7e0f147a29f42d6149585573650bd4827f3b2b93</a></p>

        <p>There was also another bug which I co-authored with Jason Merrill, but I can't seem to find the commit for it (perhaps they haven't merged it in yet). But the change log entry is <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/36eec7995b4d53083c3ee7824bd765b5eba8b1a1/gcc/cp/ChangeLog-2021" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Minecraft convolutional neural network bot</h2>
        <p>One super-fun project I did during COVID was to create a bot that used a convolutional feed-forward neural network to learn to play Minecraft... sort of. </p>
