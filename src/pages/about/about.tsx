            <h2>A bit about me</h2>
            <p className="centered">My name is Anthony and I'm a 26 year-old programmer based in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p className="centered">My dad was a programmer/electronics engineer in the 80s/90s and got me into programming at a young age. I started with Python at age 10 writing some really basic scripts (which is ironic because 26 year-old me doesn't actually know any Python). At age 12 I made my first tacky HTML-only website for a school project about India. From the age of about 13 I started getting into C++. At age 14 I started making things in Unity with C#. Despite being just about to begin a law degree, at age 17/18 I started getting more into web development, making websites, creating APIs in PHP and Go, and creating a law app for Android in Java.</p>
            <p className="centered">I guess you could say I really was a <em>junior</em> developer!</p>
            <p className="centered">If you'd like to know more, <a href="/files/Anthony Sharp - CV September 2023.pdf" target="_blank">here is my CV</a>.</p>
            <h2>Looking for someone awesome?</h2>
            <p className="centered">I was once asked in an interview <i>"What would you say makes you stand out in comparison to other candidates?"</i>. I don't really know whether they were impressed by my answer or not (if it helps, I got the job), but I <i>really</i> hated answering the question. I've always thought that it's very un-English to boast about yourself. But, I'm going to do it anyway:</p>
            <h3>Someone who actually cares</h3>
            <p className="centered point-explanation">If I see something that I think could be better, I'm not afraid to bring it up in a mature and constructive way (Even if that means more work for me!). If I have broken something, I am already working on fixing it, and thinking about how I can not do it again. If I've made something that I think could be improved (and time allows), I am already making it better.</p>
            <h3>No ego</h3>
            <p className="centered point-explanation">I know some of my portfolio is written very snappily, but actually I hate ego. I just like to focus on my work and produce the best stuff I can. I avoid drama like the plague. I am not interested in who is better than whom, or what Stacey said to Frank over lunch. Speaking of me having no ego, did you know that I am a...</p>
            <h3>Great problem solver</h3> 
            <p className="centered point-explanation">I always try to approach every problem with the mindset that there's nothing that can't be solved, no skill that can't be picked-up in a day or two (well, unless we're talking about quantum physics or something like that). I'm good at working independently and I don't think I've ever had to bother someone else for the answer to anything (unless the question was <i>"What's the password to the database?"</i>).</p>
            <h3>Good range of life experience</h3>
            <p className="centered point-explanation">Although there is a still a lot more I can learn, I've done and seen some cool things in my time - I've been the singer in bands, been to one of the best law schools in the world, learnt Japanese (sort of), got beaten-up physically in boxing club and emotionally in debate club, contributed software to the GCC compiler, watched my parents run a business for 15 years, created games, written for a magazine, worked in a team, worked out of a team, won lawsuits against landlords, had YouTube channels, been president of the hall committee, been a web developer, hosted my own servers and websites. Let me try and sell myself a bit here... You <i>could</i> hire someone with X amount of years in [insert tech stack here]. This approach is fine, and if you are just looking to fill seats, then this is often a good way to do it. But if you want someone who's actually going to bring extra added value, such as someone who is capable of understanding the needs of the business and their customers, then it's not the <i>best</i> way to make hiring decisions. That being said, I would like to emphasise that I am only young and that I don't know everything! Which brings me on to my next point...</p>
            <h3>Still learning!</h3>
            <p className="centered point-explanation">I'm still learning, and will be for the rest of my life (I'm also always forgetting, but that's a different story...). Is there something in your tech stack that I don't know? Give me two days and I'll learn it. Want to try out a new piece of tech that the company has never used before? No problem, I'll have a prototype ready by tomorrow! A lot of people are scared of trying new things, but for me it's just part of the journey that I enjoy.</p>
            <h3>Integrity and honesty</h3>
            <p className="centered point-explanation">I have strong morals and always try to do what's right. I would rather being honest make me the world's most hated person than be adored for being a fraud.</p>
